.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkeepassxc-cli\fP is the command line interface for the \fBKeePassXC\fP password manager. It provides the ability to query and modify the entries of a KeePass database, directly from the command line.

.SH COMMANDS

.IP "add [options] <database> <entry>"
Adds a new entry to a database. A password can be generated (\fI-g\fP option), or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (\fI-p\fP option).

.IP "clip [options] <database> <entry> [timeout]"
Copies the password of a database entry to the clipboard. If multiple entries with the same name exist in different groups, only the password for the first one is going to be copied. For copying the password of an entry in a specific group, the group path to the entry should be specified as well, instead of just the name. Optionally, a timeout in seconds can be specified to automatically clear the clipboard.

.IP "edit [options] <database> <entry>"
Edits a database entry. A password can be generated (\fI-g\fP option), or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (\fI-p\fP option).

.IP "entropy-meter [-a pwd1 pwd2 ...]"

.IP "merge [options] <database1> <database2>"
Merges two databases together. The first database file is going to be replaced by the result of the merge, for that reason it is advisable to keep a backup of the two database files before attempting a merge.

.IP "rm [options] <database> <entry>"
Removes an entry from a database. If the database has a recycle bin, the entry will be moved there. If the entry is already in the recycle bin, it will be removed permanently.
