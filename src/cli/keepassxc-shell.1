.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkeepassxc-shell\fP is the password shell for the \fBKeePassXC\fP password manager. It provides the ability to query and modify the entries of a KeePass database, directly from the command line.

.SH COMMANDS

.IP "add [options] <entry>"
Adds a new entry to a database. A password can be generated (\fI-g\fP option), or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (\fI-p\fP option).

.IP "clip [options] <entry> [timeout]"
Copies the password or the current TOTP (\fI-t\fP option) of a database entry to the clipboard. If multiple entries with the same name exist in different groups, only the password for the first one is going to be copied. For copying the password of an entry in a specific group, the group path to the entry should be specified as well, instead of just the name. Optionally, a timeout in seconds can be specified to automatically clear the clipboard.

.IP "edit [options] <entry>"
Edits a database entry. A password can be generated (\fI-g\fP option), or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (\fI-p\fP option).

.IP "extract [options]"

.IP "locate [options] <term>"
Locates all the entries that match a specific search term in a database.

.IP "lock [options]"

.IP "merge [options] <database2>"
Merges the current database with another database.
It is advisable to keep a backup of the two database files before attempting a merge.
In the case that both databases make use of the same credentials, the \fI--same-credentials\fP or \fI-s\fP option can be used.

.IP "rm [options] <entry>"
Removes an entry from a database. If the database has a recycle bin, the entry will be moved there. If the entry is already in the recycle bin, it will be removed permanently.

.IP "show [options] <entry>"
